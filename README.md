# Car_automax
Car Information System is a web-based application built using Python and the Django framework. This project is designed to manage and display details about various cars. It includes features that allow users to perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on car entries. Each car entry can have specific details such as name, model, brand, engine type, description, and images.

This project is an ideal example of how Django can be used to create simple and scalable web applications. It follows the MVC pattern (or MVT in Django terminology), and includes usage of Django’s models, views, templates, and admin interface.

The project can be used by automobile enthusiasts, dealerships, or learners who want to manage car listings and learn backend logic and data handling in Django. It demonstrates how to create structured models, how to connect a database (like SQLite), and how to display and manage data using dynamic HTML templates.

It also implements Django’s admin panel for backend management, allowing superusers to log in and control car listings. The frontend has been developed using basic HTML and CSS, ensuring responsiveness and clarity.

The app is currently hosted and can be run locally. Users can clone the repository and use Python virtual environments to install dependencies and run the server. The repository includes a requirements.txt file to set up all necessary packages.
